## Developer's notes

Some findings after initial playing around

- Individual Tweet pull seems not supported by rtweet
- Hashtag is good!
- User timeline is good!
- Location seems to be good, but need google maps API 
- Looks like (hashtag+location is possible)

- Have a couple search options available to users
  - # Tweets to pull
  - Pull likes by user?
  - Include RT?
  - Type (mixed, recent, popular)

- Wrap every call to search tweets in a tryCatch, so we don't crash the app. Simply reset the inputs

- I MIGHT want to use R6 to store tweets, so I can pass them around, like hexmake. Or can I get away with reactiveVal? Let's do some research
