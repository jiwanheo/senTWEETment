- Location
- User

The right side panel gives more flexibility to the search query. Some notes:

- Number of tweets is not guaranteed. 
> You are not guaranteed to get exactly `n` results back. You will get fewer results when tweets have been deleted or if you hit a rate limit. You will get more results if you ask for a number of tweets that's nota multiple of page size, e.g. if you request `n = 150` and the page size is 200, you'll get 200 results back.

- When searching by user, "Include Retweets" is defaulted to "Yes", and "Pull By" to "Recent", and are disabled from user input.

The location search is enabled by [nominatim geocoding API](https://nominatim.org/). They ask you to limit your request to a moderate level (60 per minute), please be mindful.

The resulting tweets are shown as above. The profile picture links to the user's profile, and the text links to the tweet itself.
