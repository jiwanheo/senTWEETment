# senTWEETment <img src="inst/app/www/hex.png" align="right" width="120"/>

senTWEETment is a shiny app that helps you extract and conduct sentiment analysis on tweets. It is distributed as an R package using the [golem](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/) framework.

You can pull tweets in 1 of 3 ways:

- Search word (#hashtag or any other text)
- User name
- Location (requires google maps API)
- *Search word + Location: tbd* 

This tool utilizes the text sentiment analysis process introduced in the book [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/). It currently supports 3 lexicons:

- AFINN
- Bing
- NRC

The design specification of this app can be found in the "design-spec" vignette (per engineering Shiny book)

## Installation

You can install the latest version of senTWEETment from github with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jiwanheo/senTWEETment")

# with vignettes
remotes::install_github("jiwanheo/senTWEETment", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Usage

To run the application from your local computer simply run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
senTWEETment::run_app()
```

First, you'll need a Twitter API app. Setting up and authorization can be found in the auth vignette.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# vignette("auth")
```
